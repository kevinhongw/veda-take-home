# Veda take home exercise

## Prompt

### Overview

Our client is an insurance company that provides health insurance to its members. They need your help in optimizing their provider directory to improve member experience and accessibility. Specifically, they need your help in visualizing key trends, outliers and potential areas for improvement based on member satisfaction data collected over several years.

### Dataset

For the purposes of this exercise, assume that the customer’s health plan is currently contracted with all hospital systems listed in the following dataset:

### Requirements

1. Build a web application that visualizes geospatial data on a map interface.
2. Frontend
   1. Develop a user-friendly interface to display the map, with features that allow the user to interact with the data.
   2. Utilize a TypeScript/JavaScript mapping library to render the map layer.
   3. Design features to filter and visualize the geospatial data (e.g. markers, clusters,
      heatmaps, etc)
   4. Include controls for user interaction (e.g. search, zoom, pan)
3. Backend
   1. Be prepared to discuss your assumptions and preferences for API design and database layer to serve your application.
   2. You do not need to build the API.
4. Prepare a 10 minute demonstration of your application and its core functionality.
5. Your audience will include both technically-minded business stakeholders, as well as
   software engineers.
6. Feel free to make reasonable assumptions if certain information is not explicitly provided in
   the data set. You may also relate this data to additional data sources, if applicable.
7. You may use whatever tools or techniques that best solve the problem. Your demonstration
   should note which tools you’ve selected for this project.

### Deliverables

- Please email your code solution via a git repository link prior to your scheduled technical
  interview time.
- All application code should be written in TypeScript or JavaScript, and implemented via the
  React framework. You’ll walk us through your solution during a 1-hour technical interview,
  answering questions about your implementation.
- Your presentation should include demonstration that the code is able to execute
  successfully.
- Your presentation should include a high-level diagram showing your solution architecture,
  including any tools or services you’ve chosen for your application. Bonus points for inclusion of infrastructure-as-code samples in your solution.
